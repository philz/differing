# differing

`differing` is a stand-alone code review tool. I use it to review
changes from LLM-based coding agents. It borrows from work
I did on [sketch.dev](https://sketch.dev/)'s code review tool.

This is largely vibe-coded, but I've reviewed it.

The implementation uses Monaco's diff view, and allows
you to accumulate comments which you can paste into your
favorite agent.
